# Commercial Asset and Liability Modelling for Financial Pricing and Optimization

ACST3007 Actuarial Modelling Assignment 1 (2023)

This assignment modelled asset and liability portfolios using mean-variance optimization for financial pricing and risk management. Focused on variance analysis, asset allocation, and commercial implications for pricing and optimization.

## Key Tasks
- Constructed mean-variance efficient frontier for assets and liabilities  
- Analyzed variance and covariance for portfolio optimization  
- Evaluated pricing and risk implications for financial decisions  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Mean-variance optimization for asset/liability management  
- Variance and covariance analysis  
- Commercial pricing and optimization in finance  

## Submission Details
- The attached PDF is the rendered output from an original R Markdown (.Rmd) document.  
  (Original .Rmd source file is no longer available, but the PDF preserves all calculations, frontiers, and analysis.)
